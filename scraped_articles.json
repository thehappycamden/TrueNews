Called at every Mediterranean port? Bored of the Alaskan fjords and the Baltic capitals?\n\nAn entirely new body of water may soon be open to intrepid cruise fans seeking new horizons.\n\nThe only issue: It's a landlocked sea surrounded by some of the world's most cloistered countries. But for many travel adventurers, this will be part of the appeal.\n\nBesides its fame as the main source of prized black caviar, the Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland body of water.\n\nIn fact, for a long time, not even the five countries that share it -- Azerbaijan , Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran -- could agree on whether it is a lake or a sea.\n\nBut with the decades-long dispute over its legal status resolved, the sea is now open to luxury cruising.\n\nSea or lake?\n\nThe question of whether the Caspian is a lake or sea is about more than just semantics.\n\nBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, only two countries bordered the Caspian Sea: Iran and the USSR.\n\nFor the 27 years that followed, the five countries that now had a claim to these resource-rich waters were locked in a dispute over its status.\n\nThere's plenty at stake: It's home to caviar-producing sturgeon (although fishing is currently subject to a conservation-led ban) and there are estimated reserves of around 50 billion barrels of oil and 290 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nIf the Caspian's a sea, then international law states that the seabed would be divided according to each country's coastline. That would benefit Kazakstan, with the longest shoreline, but disenfranchise Iran, which has the shortest.\n\nIf it's a lake, however, then the seabed would be divided equally.\n\nIn August 2018, leaders from the five nations met in the Kazakh coastal city of Aktau to sign a landmark deal which grants each country 15 miles of sovereign waters, a further 10 nautical miles of fishing area, and then common waters beyond.\n\nThe Caspian now has special legal status, so that it has still not been declared lake or sea. The question of how to divide subsoil territory has been put off for now, but what it does mean is that the waters are now open for new tourism opportunities, including cruising.\n\nA versatile ship\n\nl e v a r t\n\nA brand new cruise ship, the Peter the Great, is currently under construction in Astrakhan, a Russian port city at the mouth of the river Volga.\n\nThe ship will have 155 cabins and capacity for 310 passengers and is expected to launch this summer, although specific dates have not been announced and itineraries are not yet on sale.\n\nIts operator, the Moscow River Shipping Company is said to be planning one- and two-week itineraries around the Caspian Sea, calling at ports in Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Iran.\n\nThe dimensions and design of this 141-meter by 16.8-meter ship will also make it possible for it to move through Russia's network of internal waterways. This means that it'll not be confined to the Caspian and will eventually be able to reach the Baltic and Black Seas.\n\nAlthough no sailing program has been made official, reports in the Azerbaijani and Russian media indicate that the ship will alternate the Caspian cruises in winter with river itineraries along the Volga and between Moscow and Saint Petersburg in the summer. It may also conduct cruises in the Black Sea, along the Russian coast and all the way to Georgia and to the Turkish city of Trabzon.\n\nIt's likely that it will be the first of several new cruise offerings, though there is still work to be done on tourism infrastructure in the region as a whole.\n\nRussian rivers\n\nRiver cruises are quite a long-established business in Russia, with a number of local operators plying the country's main rivers.\n\nRussian rivers have even spawned a global cruise brand. Viking Cruises, now a major player name in the luxury cruise industry, traces its roots back to a small four-boat riverine operation started by a Norwegian entrepreneur in Russia in the 1990s.\n\nViking continues to have a strong operation in the country, with some 12,000 visitors carried through Russian waterways in 2018.\n\nMoving into the Caspian may open up a new area of growth for the Russian cruise industry.\n\nAlthough not as common as those in the open seas, cruises through landlocked \"seas\" (or lakes, to be more accurate) have already some tradition in more mature markets, such as North America.\n\n\"We're seeing more and more interest in the Great Lakes and their associated ports from people who visit our site. It's a great fit for people looking for something a little different,\" says Colleen McDaniel, senior executive editor of Cruise Critic.\n\n\"Ships that sail these itineraries tend to be a bit smaller, and focus on board is heavily skewed toward enrichment, as a big draw for these itineraries is history. Ships are comfortable and feature great dining, often with local flavors, but don't expect waterslides or rock-climbing walls. The ports are the stars.\"\n\nWhat's in store for passengers?\n\nThe city of Derbent and the Caspian Sea beyond, as seen from the walls of Derbent Fortress. Shutterstock\n\nAt more than 370,000 sq kilometers (143,000 sq miles), the Caspian is considerably larger than all of North America's Great Lakes combined, to which you can add the diversity of natural ecosystems and civilizations that have thrived along its shores. Passengers on the Peter the Great will have no shortage of sights and attractions to visit.\n\nThey will be able to enjoy the charms of the Azerbaijani capital, Baku , the largest city on the Caspian shore and its likely base port, but also ancient cities such as Derbent, at the southern tip of Russia, the deserts on the sea's eastern shore and Iran's subtropical riviera.\n\nBut before you get too excited, you'd better check each of these countries' visa requirements.\n\nIn the case of Iran, for example, the US State Department has a travel advisory note advising American citizens not to visit the country at all.\n\nEven if you're not a US citizen, a recent visit to Iran may complicate later trips to the United States. For example, you would be denied access to the ESTA program, and you would then need to apply for a visa at your nearest US Embassy, plus you may be subject to additional scrutiny at the border ( as former NATO secretary general Javier Solana found last year ).\n\nAzerbaijan has simplified its visa restrictions in recent years, introducing a quick-access electronic visa for which close to 100 countries are eligible.\n\nRelated content The mud volcano capital of the world\n\nGame-changer\n\nIn any case, the majority passengers on this new cruise is likely to be Russian citizens, followed by those of the other Caspian countries.\n\n\"We are confident in the prospects of these cruises and we are looking forward to the entry of the ship Peter the Great. We expect great demand and interest in this product,\" says Denis Kreitsberg, managing director of Kruiz.online, a Russian cruise marketplace.\n\nThese developments also fit with the current growth of the Russian cruise market.\n\n\"We are seeing growth rates of 15-20% annually in the number of Russians that go on sea cruises. Most of these travel abroad to complete a cruise,\" says Fedor Egorov, managing director of Dreamlines Russia, the local branch of the international cruise portal of the same name.\n\nPerhaps fittingly, this new ship is named after the czar who, in the early 18th century, campaigned extensively in the Caspian region, conquering large swathes of land along the way.", "link": "https://cnn.com/travel/article/caspian-sea-cruises/index.html", "published": "2019-05-31T09:28:11+00:00"}, {"title": "10 things you need to know about Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge", "text": "Black Spire Outpost, Batuu (aka Disneyland, Anaheim, California) (CNN) \u2014 No doubt that the lines at Disneyland's Galaxy's Edge will be long as the new Star Wars land opens today, but there are still many unique experiences to seek out.\n\nAs we wait for the land's second ride to open by year's end, here are 10 of our favorites to track down in Galaxy's Edge that will be sure to delight hardcore Star Wars fans and indoctrinate new ones.\n\nPilot the Millennium Falcon, twice\n\nGuests sit in the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run ride. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nGiven that it's the only ride currently open in Galaxy's Edge, you're unlikely to miss the opportunity to fly the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy. But try to go twice if you can, even if you have to split up your party and take the singles line (there is no MaxPass).\n\nBecause you control the outcome of the ride, the first time you pilot the Falcon you may be (as I was) so awed or bewildered by the experience that you crash a lot, which lowers your score.\n\nBut the second time, you'll have it down, including that down is up and up is down for the right hand side pilot controller. You'll be able to soak it in and enjoy it more the second time as well. And as a bonus: twice as much time hanging out in the main hold of the iconic ship, which is nearly as exciting as the ride itself.\n\nHug and talk to a $25,000 R2-D2\n\nGuests can also build their own personal droids. Michelle Groskopf for CNN\n\nIn the back of the build-you-own-droid shop you may glimpse everyone's favorite astromech droid and notice it carries a hefty price tag. The reason is because it talks to you, follows you and likes hugs. If he's powered down, wait for a cast member to turn him on.\n\nEverything you can't buy in the antiquities shop\n\nDok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities includes a mounted tauntaun (top right) from \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" Michelle Groskopf for CNN\n\nDok-Ondar's Den of Antiquities is full of exciting items for sale, including Luke's lightsaber, a General Grievous mask and an Imperial Fighter Helmet. But stand in the middle of the circular shop and make a slow 360-degree turn to notice all the Easter eggs from past Star Wars films displayed like a haphazard museum on the walls and upstairs. These are the items Dok-Ondar won't part with, but it's a still a thrill to spot them.\n\nTo get your scavenger hunt started, look for: Han Solo's gun, an OG Imperial stormtrooper helmet, a baby Sarlacc monster pit, a Clone Wars-era clone soldier helmet, a mounted tauntaun head and the helmet of bounty hunter Boushh, worn by Princess Leia to rescue Han in \"Return of the Jedi.\"\n\nTipsy at the Cantina\n\nGrab a drink at Og's Cantina. Michelle Groskopf for CNN\n\nThere's only one place in Disneyland where you can enjoy an alcoholic beverage and it's in Og's Cantina in Galaxy's Edge. Imbibe responsibly on beer (Bad Motivator IPA and White Wampa Ale among others), hard cider (Spice Runner), wine or a cosmic cocktail such as a rummy tiki Yub Nub, a sweet Fuzzy Tauntaun, an Outer Rim margarita, a botanical Jedi Mind Trick and a cloudy, bubbling pink Bespin Fizz. The Cantina is one of the most fun spots to hang out too as the barkeeps and droid DJ (R3X, a former pilot droid from the old Star Tours ride), like to put on a show.\n\nSpace pet\n\nA Porg plush toy is displayed for sale in the Black Spire Outpost Marketplace. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn the Creature stall you may find another that captures your heart, but I doubt it will be as cute as a Porg. \"The Last Jedi\" birds have puppet controls that let you flap their wings and make them squawk. Adorbs.\n\n'There's something alive in here.'\n\nA guest takes a photo of a dianoga creature. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn the marketplace area is a water fountain. Above it is a vat of colored water. And in that vat resides a familiar slimy one-eyed water serpent called a dianoga you may recall tried to drown Luke in the Death Star trash compactor scene in \"A New Hope.\" It's just one of the many, many hidden callbacks to films you will delight in finding around the land.\n\nScore!\n\nThe rough, earth-toned aesthetic, that dates all the way back to Ralph McQuarrie's original concept drawings, is recreated in detail in Galaxy's Edge. Michelle Groskopf for CNN\n\nStop to notice the theme park land's original score by none other than the original Star Wars maestro, John Williams. As you enter Galaxy's Edge, the music swells to induce the feeling that you're about to take center stage in your own Star Wars adventure, which you are.\n\nExclusive product 'Tie'-in\n\nFirst Order Stormtroopers guard the TIE echelon ship. Richard Harbaugh/Disney Parks\n\nBefore the First Order Stormtroopers tell you to \"Move along,\" take a long gander at something you've never seen before: a TIE echelon ship. With its pointed tips and long Imperial ramp it's a beautiful, sleek and slightly terrifying ship. And you can buy a scale model at the First Order stall next door and bring this exclusive-to-the-park toy home with you.\n\nMeatless meat\n\nThe Felucian Garden Spread is available at Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo. David Roark/Disney Parks\n\nThere are plenty of meaty options available in Galaxy's Edge, but one of them is actually not meat. The Disney chefs give Impossible Foods a run for their money with their juicy, chewy, slightly spicy, plant-based \"kefta\" meatball served with hummus and pita in the Felucian Garden Spread. Don't miss it.\n\n'Fuzzball'\n\nChewbacca can be found at Galaxy's Edge.

recommended an improvement in information sharing between agencies.\n\nThe NSCB also said police warnings about risks posed by an adult's behaviour towards a child \"should be taken more

At the same time, Brexit uncertainty has cast a pall over the industry, with the threat of tariffs on cars and parts travelling to and from the UK.\n\nFord is the latest in a string of international carmakers to seek to drastically reduce its UK operations this year. In February, Honda announced it planned to shut its Swindon plant in 2021 with the loss of 3,500 jobs, while fellow Japanese carmaker Nissan reversed a decision to build its new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant.\n\nJaguar Land Rover, owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, is also cutting thousands of jobs.

In January, Ford announced widespread job losses across its European operations, saying it would consider closing plants. Last month, it announced plans to cut about 7,000 jobs worldwide, or 10% of its global salaried workforce, including about 550 in the UK.\n\nThe overhaul across Europe, which included shutting down loss-making vehicle lines, has already resulted in the combination of the headquarters of Ford UK and Ford Credit to a site in Dunton, Essex, in an attempt to cut costs.\n\nFord runs three factories in the UK, including a diesel engine plant in Dagenham, east London, and a plant making transmissions in Halewood, on the outskirts of Liverpool.\n\nA Ford spokesman refused to comment on the closure plan, saying it was \u201cspeculation\u201d.\n\nThe Bridgend plant has manufactured engines since 1980. However, the plant, which sends petrol engines to Ford factories across Europe, was thought to be particularly at risk because a contract to manufacture engines for JLR will end this year.\n\nThe company has also been outspoken about the risks to the sector posed by Brexit.

On Monday, troops from the Rapid Support Forces, an infamous paramilitary unit, attacked the sit-in protest site that activists had occupied for the past two months. At least 60 people were killed and hundreds more wounded. By the following day, the site had been dismantled and cleared by the paramilitary forces, which also set up checkpoints and locked down parts of Khartoum.\n\n\u201cPockets of defiant protesters gathered at mosques on Tuesday, turning their prayers for the Eid al-Fitr holiday into calls for sustained civil disobedience,\u201d my colleagues reported. \u201cSporadic gunfire could still be heard throughout Khartoum and its suburbs.\u201d\n\nThe violence marked a grim turn for what had been a hopeful moment in Sudan. In scenes redolent of the Arab world\u2019s 2011 pro-democracy uprisings, an emboldened grass-roots protest movement had taken root in the heart of the Sudanese capital, clamoring for democratic reform and political change. Their stamina and courage led to the April ouster of long-ruling President Omar al-Bashir by top military officials within his regime.\n\n23/05/2019 - this was the scene at the Khartoum sit-in. A night of culture, revolutionary art and national pride. No one could have imagined what would happen 10 days later. Many of those in attendance have been beaten, arrested and shot at over the last two days. pic.twitter.com/DvBlPtB541 \u2014 Yousra Elbagir (@YousraElbagir) June 4, 2019\n\nBut the protesters never trusted the Transitional Military Council that came into place after Bashir\u2019s removal and insisted that the generals transfer authority to civilians. They had good reason to distrust the top brass \u2014 the senior officials of the TMC all have deep ties to Bashir and the complex security apparatus he built. The military and protest leaders met for rounds of failed negotiations concerning the way forward, while a generation of Sudanese activists gathered in hopeful vigil and protest in the heart of Khartoum. On May 28, they called for a two-day general strike.\n\nThe military\u2019s response was to crack down. After the Rapid Support Forces moved in, TMC head Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced the end of dialogue with the protest movement, deemed the protest site as a potential \u201cthreat to national security,\u201d and said the military council would fast-track the transitional period and stage presidential elections within nine months. That\u2019s bad news for pro-democracy activists and opposition parties, which need more time to muster the resources to contest an election against entrenched regime forces.\n\n\u201cThe concern is the TMC \u2026 will now link up with old regime elements and so the elections will open the way for the old regime to come back into power. It is very worrying,\u201d Rosalind Marsden, a Sudan expert at Chatham House, told the Guardian.\n\nIt\u2019s also a blueprint seen elsewhere in the Arab world. In Algeria, a committed protest movement that forced the departure of the country\u2019s aging, enfeebled president is still locked in a tense standoff with a military elite that is bent on preserving their control over large sections of the state. In Egypt, Sudanese protesters have a clear example of what happens when a pro-democratic revolution eventually gets swept away by a vicious counterrevolution led by the military establishment.\n\nA coup against Egypt\u2019s unpopular but democratically elected government in 2013 was followed by a massacre of Islamist protesters that drew parallels to the killings at Tiananmen Square in 1989. That coup leader, Abdel Fatah el-Sissi, is now the country\u2019s strongman and potential president for life.\n\nNot surprisingly, Burhan and his allies recently called on Sissi and also paid visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The two gulf monarchies are especially hostile to the prospect of democratic upheaval in their wider neighborhood and promised $3 billion in aid to Sudan to provide for the country\u2019s \u201cstability.\u201d But experts see a disturbing trend in play, where Arab authoritarians guarantee their preferred political order, preside over shocking repression and human rights abuses and pay little price for it.\n\nSudan\u2019s military rulers are drawing \u201clessons from the impunity for murdering opponents enjoyed by [Saudi crown prince] Mohammed bin Salman and Sissi who are now backing them,\u201d Timothy Kaldas, a Cairo-based analyst for the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told Today\u2019s WorldView. \u201cTheir backing by regional authoritarians who themselves have escaped any consequences for violently repressing opponents may have emboldened them to follow their example and use deadly force against protesters in Sudan.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the military prevails in Sudan, it will mark a victory as well for these ruthless despots and their road-to-nowhere style of governance,\u201d noted an editorial in The Washington Post that called out the negative role played by the Saudis and Emiratis.\n\nKaldas cautioned, though, that Sudan \u201clacks the comparable strategic value\u201d that a country like Egypt or Saudi Arabia has for many Western governments. For more than a decade, Bashir, who is wanted on genocide and crimes against humanity charges by the International Criminal Court, was a global villain in the eyes of the West and his regime the subject of various international sanctions. The RSF has its antecedents in the notorious Janjaweed militia that carried out mass atrocities in Sudan\u2019s restive Darfur region.\n\nU.S. officials slammed the crackdown this week, with White House national security adviser John Bolton describing the move to attack the protesters as \u201cabhorrent.\u201d Tibor Nagy, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Africa, decried \u201ca brutal and coordinated attack, led by the Rapid Support Forces militia, that mirrors some of the worst offenses of the Bashir regime.\u201d\n\n\n\nProtesters set up a barricade in Khartoum to stop military vehicles from driving through the area on Tuesday. (Ashraf Shazly/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nBut analysts aren\u2019t convinced that the United States will do much more than scold. \u201cThe international community \u2014 so interested and morally exercised by Bashir\u2019s human rights abuses in the past that it has left Sudan hobbled by years of economic sanctions and international isolation \u2014 has now moved on,\u201d wrote British-Sudanese columnist Nesrine Malik. \u201cIt will only issue the usual boilerplate condemnations of violence.\u201d\n\nMalik summed up the grim struggle ahead: \u201cWhat the Sudanese revolution is reckoning with now is the very heart of Bashir\u2019s government distilled into its essential parts: networks of patronage with too much to lose, militias grown too large to disband, and dirty deals with regional allies too important to jettison.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, pro-democracy activists are promising to carry out more civil disobedience in Khartoum and elsewhere in the country. Makeshift barricades sprang up in the capital on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice but to continue,\u201d said Mohammed Yousef Mustafa, a spokesman for one of the lead protest organizations.\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

They included avoiding the sun between noon and 3 p.m. and refraining from drinking alcohol, tea and coffee.

(Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe heat wave is part of a trend of rising temperatures in India. Last year was the sixth-warmest since national record-keeping began in 1901; 11 of the 15 warmest years on record have all occurred since 2004. The frequency of heat waves is also increasing, a government minister told India\u2019s Parliament earlier this year.\n\n[Brutal heat wave in India puts 330 million people at risk]\n\nThat adds up to a huge policy challenge, noted Hem Dholakia, an environmental researcher, in a piece published last month. \u201cScience as well as our subjective experiences has made it unequivocally clear that longer, hotter and deadlier summers are poised to become the norm due to climate change,\u201d he wrote. Every Indian city needs a plan for combating extreme heat, he said.\n\nA pioneer in that effort was the city of Ahmedabad in the state of Gujarat, which first instituted a heat action plan in 2013. The city started an early warning system to inform the public about extreme temperatures, expanded access to drinking water, encouraged employers to change work schedules so people spent less time outdoors, and repainted roofs so they reflected rather than absorbed heat. One study suggested the city avoided more than 1,000 deaths each year thanks to such measures.\n\n\n\nAn family drinks free cold sweet water on a highway during a hot afternoon at Garhi village in the northern Indian state of Haryana on Monday. (Money Sharma/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIndia\u2019s National Disaster Management Authority has also worked, with considerable success, to reduce the number of deaths due to heat waves in recent years. According to government figures, such fatalities have fallen from 700 in 2016 to 20 last year.\n\nKuldeep Srivastava, head of the regional forecasting center at the India Meteorological Department in New Delhi, said that the current heat wave would abate within a few days as moisture-laden winds push into the most severely affected regions. But real relief will come only with the arrival of the monsoon season. Such rains are expected to begin any day now in Kerala, on India\u2019s southwestern coast, but will take several more weeks to work their way north.\n\nMeanwhile, in Churu, normal life has stopped. Hanuman Verma, a local journalist, said that residents are hunkering down in their homes, avoiding work and refraining from shopping during the day.

Federal agents later reviewed more than 9,000 documents, according to John Lyons, ABC News\u2019s executive editor.\n\n\u201cI have to say, sitting here watching police using a media organisation\u2019s computers to track everything to do with a legitimate story I can\u2019t help but think: this is a bad, sad and dangerous day for a country where we have for so long valued \u2014 and taken for granted \u2014 a free press,\u201d Lyons tweeted.\n\nThe raid is the second this week by Australian Federal Police on a journalist and comes at a time of growing concerns of eroded press freedoms around the world and in the U.S. Advocates decried the police actions at ABC\u2019s headquarters and warned it would have a chilling effect on investigative reporting in the country.\n\n\u201cAttacks on public interest whistleblowers and the free press drive at the heart of our democracy,\u201d said Emily Howie, a legal director at Australia\u2019s Human Rights Law Centre. \u201cGovernments may be uncomfortable about journalists exposing wrongdoing, but that\u2019s precisely why a free press is absolutely vital.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Federal Police hasn\u2019t specified why it targeted the ABC but in a statement said the warrant was \u201cin relation to allegations of publishing classified material,\u201d citing a 1914 law forbidding the release of secret government information. Police added that no arrests were expected today.\n\nLeaders at the ABC vowed to protect sources and continue investigative reporting about the government.\n\n\u201cThis is a serious development and raises legitimate concerns over freedom of the press and proper public scrutiny of national security and defence matters,\u201d the ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, said in a statement. \u201cThe ABC stands by its journalists, will protect its sources and continue to report without fear or favour on national security and intelligence issues when there is a clear public interest.\u201d\n\nFederal police, dressed in suits and accompanied by IT specialists, showed up at the ABC\u2019s headquarters around 11:30 a.m. local time. Their warrant covered an \u201cextraordinary range\u201d of people and documents related to the Afghan files, Lyons tweeted, mentioning handwritten and digital notes, emails and even graphics related to the piece.\n\nAgents, lawyers and broadcast executives huddled in a room and reviewed 9,214 files, Lyons wrote, including thousands of internal emails. In the end, the government downloaded files to USB drives and agreed to a two-week \u201chiatus,\u201d Lyons reported, to allow the ABC time to challenge the seizures in court.\n\nWednesday\u2019s raid came less than 24 hours after federal agents showed up with a warrant at the Canberra home of Annika Smethurst, the Sunday Telegraph of Sydney\u2019s political editor, who had reported on alleged plans to allow greater surveillance of Australian citizens. Agents searched her home, computer and phone. News Corp Australia, her employer, argued that the raid \u201csends clear and dangerous signals to journalists and newsrooms across Australia.\u201d\n\nAustralian Federal Police said the two raids were not connected.\n\n\u201cThe Afghan Files,\u201d the July 2017 story at the center of Wednesday\u2019s police action, raised public outrage with details of special forces soldiers who had allegedly killed unarmed civilians.

(Noa Pothoven/Facebook)\n\nClarification: An earlier version of this story reported that Noa Pothoven\u2019s death came via euthanasia, which she had initially requested. The Dutch Health Ministry said Wednesday that Noa\u2019s family was maintaining that euthanasia \u2014 the definition of which is contested \u2014 had not occurred while indicating that the circumstances of her death were still being investigated.\n\nA Dutch teenager who suffered from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anorexia after being raped as a child was allowed to die at her home, her sister confirmed on Sunday.\n\nIn what she termed a \u201csad last post\u201d on Instagram, Noa Pothoven, 17, wrote Saturday that she would be dead within 10 days. But it had been \u201cso long,\u201d she added, since she had \u201creally been alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter years of struggling and fighting, it\u2019s over,\u201d she wrote. The teenager, from the city of Arnhem in the eastern part of the Netherlands, said she had stopped eating and drinking and would soon be \u201creleased because my suffering is unbearable.\u201d\n\nHer decision was not \u201cimpulsive,\u201d she emphasized. Rather, it was the result of \u201cmany conversations and assessments.\u201d Offering her own blunt review of her condition, she observed, \u201cI survive, and not even that. I breathe but no longer live.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear whether her death had come with the involvement of doctors, whose assistance she had at one point requested. In a statement to The Washington Post on Wednesday, Hugo de Jonge, the Dutch minister of health, welfare and sport, said her family had indicated that, \u201cthere is no question of euthanasia in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuestions about her death and the care she has received are understandable, but can only be answered once the facts have been established,\u201d the minister added. \"I have asked the Health and Youth Care Inspectorate to look into this.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican mourned her passing Wednesday morning on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNoa\u2019s death is a great loss for any civil society and for humanity,\u201d Pontifical Academy for Life wrote. \u201cWe must always assert the positive reasons for life.\u201d\n\nPope Francis, in a separate message, stated, \u201cEuthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all. We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope.\u201d\n\nAssisted suicide is legal in parts of Europe and the United States, although rules differ about the degree to which a third party may actively carry out the patient\u2019s death. Active euthanasia, as it is known, is lawful in only a handful of countries, including Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.\n\nThe Netherlands became the first country to legalize the practice, in legislation passed in 2001, the year Noa was born. The vote in the Dutch parliament was the culmination of a campaign that began in 1973, following the prosecution of a general practitioner who had ended the life of her mother after a cerebral hemorrhage left her partly paralyzed, deaf and mostly unable to speak.\n\nHowever, the approval of the legislation was also marked by impassioned protest from Christian groups. A crowd of at least 5,000 people, many of them children, undertook a silent march to register their objection as lawmakers considered the measure.\n\nUnder the law, euthanasia by doctors is permitted only in cases of \u201chopeless and unbearable\u201d suffering.\n\nThe End of Life Clinic in The Hague, where Noa had sought services, spells out the narrow circumstances under which doctors \u201cmay provide assisted dying,\u201d requiring that \u201cthe patient makes a clear and autonomous request and is enduring unbearable and unendurable suffering.\u201d There must be no other reasonable solution, and patients have to demonstrate understanding of the \u201cconsequences of what they are requesting.\u201d Doctors are required to seek counsel from an \u201cindependent colleague, who is not familiar with the patient.\u201d\n\nChildren as young as 12 can seek euthanasia under Dutch law, but those 12 to 16 must obtain parental consent. Physician-assisted suicide is available to adults only in places where it is legal in the United States, which includes seven states and the District. In 2014, Belgium became the first country to legalize euthanasia for children.\n\nThe procedure accounted for less than 4.4 percent of all deaths in the Netherlands in 2017, according to a report from a review committee. Of the 6,585 requests that were granted, most were in cases of untreatable cancer. Only a small number involved psychiatric distress. The process is carried out by an attending physician who administers a lethal dose of a \u201csuitable drug,\u201d according to Dutch guidelines.\n\nNoa initially approached the clinic last year, without her parents\u2019 knowledge, but was turned away. She was told that she was too young, according to a 2018 profile of her in the Dutch newspaper De Gelderlander.\n\n\u201cThey think I\u2019m too young to die,\u201d said Noa, who was 16 at the time, explaining how she had been instructed to complete a trauma treatment and wait until her brain was more fully developed. She lamented the decision, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t wait that long.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the clinic did not return a request for comment.\n\nNoa\u2019s trials are detailed in an award-winning autobiography released last year, titled \u201cWinning or Learning.\u201d According to her parents, who were frantically searching for new treatments for their daughter, the book should be \u201cmandatory\u201d for social workers and other authorities responsible for youth care. (The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline provides free and confidential support for people in distress.)\n\nIn her book, Noa traces the origins of her mental anguish. At the age of 11, she was assaulted at a school party \u2014 and again at a gathering of teenagers a year later. When she was 14, she writes, she was raped by two men in the Elderveld neighborhood of Arnhem.\n\nFor years, she kept the violations secret, out of shame. It was only years later that her family learned what she had endured, after her mother came across a cache of letters saying goodbye to her loved ones. She remained too afraid to make a formal declaration to the police. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d the teenager said.\n\nLisa Westerveld, a Dutch lawmaker who had visited Noa before her death, when she was surrounded by family and friends in her living room, said she was struck by the teenager\u2019s strength. She told De Gelderlander that it was \u201cnice to see her again,\u201d although the circumstances were \u201csurreal.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Westerveld told The Washington Post that she did not know more about the circumstances of the teenager\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI will never forget her,\u201d the lawmaker vowed. \u201cWe will continue her struggle.\u201d\n\nThe health minister struck a similar tone, saying, \u201cour hearts go out to her family and friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe family must now be allowed to grieve for Noa in peace,\u201d he added.\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\n\u2018An unexpected turn of events\u2019: An elderly woman spun wildly in a basket under a rescue helicopter\n\nShe hit record before falling seven stories to her death.
