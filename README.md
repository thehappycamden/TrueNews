# TrueNews - Generate New News Articles Using Recursive Neural Networks.
These are some python scripts for downloading news articles off the web via `NewsScraper.py`, converting them to a plaintext file with `NewsParser.py`, and feeding them into a recursive neural network using the `textgenrnn` module in `FILE NOT YET MADE`.

For more info read comments in `NewsScraper.py` and `NewsParser.py`.
